# Description: The read-discipline core's input shapes (SDD-001 §3.2, §4.4).
#   `CandidateNode` is the structural-fact bundle a §3.3 retrieval operation
#   supplies per node — the #9/#21 exclusion indicators, the applicability
#   marker, its resolved `HAS_CONDITION` set, and the envelope attribution
#   (app.domain.shared.envelope) — so the read-discipline core never touches
#   the graph itself; operations do the traversal (R3+) and hand candidates in.
#   `ConsumingContext` is the §3.2 consuming-context payload. `CitationPage`
#   (R6a) is unrelated to the trio — citation-lookup is the audit-posture
#   exception (§1) and never builds a `CandidateNode` — it lives here only as
#   the shared home for retrieval-operation input shapes. Pure data — no
#   behavior lives here.
